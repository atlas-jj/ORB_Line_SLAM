--------------------------
+ This repository served as my CMPUT630 Course Project in 2017.
+ This repository is **no longer maintained** since I moved my interest to robot manipulation research.
+ Current problem is the accuracy of line correspondence detection when using the sparse feature points generated by ORB-SLAM. That's also the reason why very few map points are generated apart from the original points in ORB-SLAM.
+ If you happen to feel this code helps you a little bit, that's all the values of this repo here. 
+ You can star it, but no need to cite it. It's not an originally research project.
+ If you are interested in SLAM using line features, I higly recommend you the research done by our lab member Shida:
