--------------------------
+ This repository served as my CMPUT630 Course Project in 2017.
+ This repository is **no longer maintained** since I moved my interest to robot manipulation research.
+ Current problem is the accuracy of line correspondence detection when using the sparse feature points generated by ORB-SLAM. That's also the reason why very few map points are generated apart from the original points in ORB-SLAM.
+ If you are interested in SLAM using line features, I higly recommend you the research done by our lab member Shida: 

### [Incremental 3D Line Segment Extraction for Surface Reconstruction from Semi-dense SLAM](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~vis/thesis_shida/ "Incremental 3D Line Segment Extraction for Surface Reconstruction from Semi-dense SLAM")

Some results from Shida's work:
